             <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> My name is Patience Akpan but I want to be called Beny. I am from Nigeria. I am a first-class graduate of Economics from Ghana Technology University College,<a id="profile-link" href="https://site.gtuc.edu.gh">(GTUC)</a> Ghana and a web developer graduate from <a id="profile-link" href="https://abocoders.org.ng">Abocoders.</a> </p>
        
        <p> <b>My Attributes</b> are Diligence, Honesty & Passion for excellence. I love to learn and  pay attention to details.
</p>

     <p> Tech drive, motivated me to start learning about web dev. I started with online learning 'computer programming for everyone' at the University of leeds and Institute of coding and obtained a certificate of achievement . Again, I enrolled in another online program with IBM 'Introduction to coding' and  others coding programs. I also enrolled in Free Code <a id="profile-link" href="https://abocoders.org.ng">Camp.</a> and finally I got the opportunity to be trained as a web developer at Abocoders, an NGO. But, my learning continues as I want to become a Full Stack developer in the future.
     I have also make contributions in open source communities like Eclipse Adoptium, Fedora community, Edam Ontology, etc.
     I am open to learning, internships and job opportunities both voluntary and paid jobs. Thank you.
